# Deep Learning Empowered Detection of Large Language Model Based Generative Content in Educational Tasks
**Abstract:**
With the increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in education, students and researchers are more frequently using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to solve problems. Therefore, distinguishing generated and original text has become increasingly critical. This study explores the feasibility of traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms within the intelligence augmentation (IA) framework for recognizing generated text, based on a comprehensive dataset encompassing tasks in article generation, text paraphrasing, and code generation. We evaluate the performance of various deep learning and machine learning models for generated text recognition using both combined and single methods, with final testing conducted on real-world data in the class. Experimental results across the three tasks and real-world data demonstrate that deep learning algorithms achieve superior performance, with an accuracy of 85% on real classroom data, surpassing traditional machine learning algorithms and even the latest zero-shot methods. These findings provide valuable insights for distinguishing generated and original texts in education and IA, facilitating the development of advanced IA tools and contributing to solutions for academic misconduct issues.
